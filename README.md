# create-and-terminate-child-processes

## A bit over-engineered solution but it works:

```
 SAMPLE OUTPUT:
Child: [PID: 6801] CREATED
Child: [PID: 6802] CREATED
Child: [PID: 6803] CREATED
Child: [PID: 6804] CREATED
 Child: [PID:6801] TERMINATED 
 Child: [PID:6802] TERMINATED 
 Child: [PID:6803] TERMINATED 
 Child: [PID:6804] TERMINATED 
```
